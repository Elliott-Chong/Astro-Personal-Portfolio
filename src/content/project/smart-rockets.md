This is a showcase of genetic algorithms, a search heuristic inspired by natural evolution.

The fittest elements of the population gets crossbred and reproduces the next generation with their genes. After many generations, they will eventually converge on the optimal genes for the task at hand.

The fitness of each rocket is calculated by the inverse of the distance between it and the target at the end of its lifespan.
