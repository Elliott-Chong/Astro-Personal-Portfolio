Built with DaisyUI and TailwindCSS, this project serves as a **simple and minimalistic todo list for the power user**, featuring a theme switcher and persistent storage using LocalStorage.

## Motivation

As a developer, we like to reinvent the wheel. This project serves as a way for me to learn TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, and also to create a todo app that I would use.
